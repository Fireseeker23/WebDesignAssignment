<div class="About">
   <p>Dishonored 2 is an action-adventure game based on players’ stealth skill. The game is played from the first-person perspective and includes several RPG elements. It is a sequel to the original Dishonored game, so the story takes place in Dunwall and mostly in Karnaca 12 years after the ending of the previous part. To start the action, the player has to decide whether he wants to assume the role of deposed Empress Emily or the role of her father and the Royal Protector Corvo, the protagonist of the first Dishonored game. Both characters have their own bunch of special abilities so the choice will influence the way of returning to the throne. In the course of the game, both equipment and abilities can be upgraded. The storyline is divided into several main missions and includes various side quests that let protagonists get acquainted with the useful new skills. Although the gameplay is initially focused on the stealth, actually there is a multitude of ways to complete all the missions and to return the lost honor.
